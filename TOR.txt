Implement URL Status Checker
Django project git repository with application code that:
- Allow store and manipulate with set of URL (stored in DB, using django ORM), manipulation (add/delete) via Django admin.
- Simple view for authenticated users, that shows list of added URLS, monitors url HTTP response status (using Ajax request to server), lets choose check interval, pause individual links check
- On ajax request, server should check (in async) all users links listed in db and return HTTP status code of urls (200 - green row in list, other - red row in list).
